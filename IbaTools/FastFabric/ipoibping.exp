	# --------------------------------------

	# ADD ANY GLOBAL INITIALIZATION HERE, SUCH AS:

	# abort_now should be 0 if it is safe to proceed and simply ignore all
	# test_case calls.  it should be 1 if that is not possible.

	# --------------------------------------

	# The actual test cases:
	# ----------------------
