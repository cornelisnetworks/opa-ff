# This file controls the opareport Port Counter Thresholds.
# [ICS VERSION STRING: unknown]
#
# Error Counters are specified in absolute number of errors since last cleared.
# All Data Movement thresholds are specified in terms of absolute data
# since last cleared.
#
# Setting a threshold to 0 disables monitoring of the given counter
#
# Output is generated when a threshold is exceeded.
#
# Counters for which a non-zero threshold is specified will be checked
# and potentially cleared by opareport and related tools using opareport.

Threshold                  Greater  # how to compare counter to threshold
                                    # Greater - reports values > threshold
                                    # Equal - reports values >= threshold
                                    # Does not apply to Link Quality Indicator
