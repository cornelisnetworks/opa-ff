# [ICS VERSION STRING: unknown]
## prep
## ----
## This script will mark all the files in a release with the appropriate
## release tag
##
## Usage:
##	cd $CODE_DIR; find . -print|prep [version_marker]
##
## Arguments:
##	version_marker - the string to look for at the start of each
##		version string in scripts, and the string to add (with tag
##		appended) to mark all files.  For example: "ICS VERSION STRING"
##		The default is "ICS VERSION STRING"
##
## Environment expected:
##	TL_DIR = top level directory
##	RELEASE_TAG = cvs release tag to mark in each file
##	MCS = mcs program to use (defaults to mcs)
##	AR = ar program to use (default to ar)
##	DATE = date string to include in file (defaults to current date/time)
##
## Method of marking:
##	archives, executables, dynamic libraries, relocatable .o's
##		On Linux/Cygwin:
##		- version string appended at end of file
##		Future/Other:
##		- mcs used to put version string in .comment section of ELF file
##	other files (text, etc)
##		- sed used to replace "$version_marker:.*]" with the version
##		  string.  Note that the version string in text files ends in a
##		  ] and will include "$version_marker:", hence prep can be
##		  run multiple times against a given file/tree
