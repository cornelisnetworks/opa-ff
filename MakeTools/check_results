## check_results
## -----------
## Examine the output from the build and filter it into warning and error
## files allowing for quick analysis of the success of the build
## This is used by the weeklybuild script to provide product specific
## build operations for product's whose analysis of results is more complex
## than simply grepping for various error keywords
##
## Usage:
## When this is invoked, the current directory will be the TL_DIR for a
## full checkout of the product to be built
##
## Usage:
##	check_results [-r] [-e add_error] [-E add_error_filter]
##		 [-w add_warn] [-W add_warn_filter]
##		 results_file errors_file warn_file
##
## Arguments:
##	-r - generate a report on success/failure of a build and
##		exit with a status of 1 for failure, 0 for success
##	-e add_error - additional egrep patterns for identifying errors
##		must start with |
##	-E add_error_filter - additional egrep patterns to filter out of errors
##		must start with |
##	-w add_warn - additional egrep patterns for identifying warnings
##		must start with |
##	-W add_warn_filter - additional egrep patterns to filter out of warnings
##		must start with |
##	results_file - input file containing results from a weeklybuild
##		could be a full or partial (limited OS/build_config/build_smp combos)
##		build
##	errors_file - output file where serious errors should be output which
##		reflect a build failure
##	warn_file - output file where non-serious errors and warning should be
##		output which might reflect a minor problem or a bug in code detected by
##		the compilers
##
## In addition, the following environment variables are expected to be set:
##	RELEASE_TAG, BRANCH_TAG, BUILD_TARGET, PRODUCT, RELEASE_HOME, BUILD_CONFIG 
##	The target command is expected to have already been run to set up the
##	environment for the specified target
