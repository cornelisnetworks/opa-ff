## This file replaces the use of the TCLLIBPATH environment variable on Mac
## (since the TCLLIBPATH environment variable doesn't work on Mac)
## This file should be sourced by all expect scripts that need to use 
## procedures in the following files (when running on Mac).
##
## It won't have effect on Linux, or to be more precise, it won't break code
## on Linux.
