# This directory contains makerules files.  These files control the compiler and
# linker flags and provide mechanisms for individual makefiles to augment the
# defaults as needed

## Global Make Settings File
## ----------------------
## All project makesettings files (or local makefiles not associated with a
## specific project) should include this file
## before the local definitions section.
## This file allows setting variables which can be used by Makefiles to make
## decisions on which targets or DIRS to build.  This allows such controls
## to be placed here as opposed to extending the build system environment
## variable tools like setenv, target, etc.
##
## Global Make Rules File
## ----------------------
## All project makerules files (or local makefiles not associated with a
## specific project) should include this file
## after the local definitions section and before the local rules section.  The
## function of the global makerules file is to define the system applications,
## standardized make targets (rules) and commonly used variables and structure.
## The makefile is coded so that it is platform independent.  Specifics to a
## given platform are taken care of in 'ifdef' type statements so that the
## makefile can be used on all platforms with little or no modification.  Any
## modifications to the source should be made with portability in mind and
## should follow the embedded notations.
##
## More information about the
## execution of the makefile can be had by specifying the -d option on the
## command line to make.
##
## NOTE: This makerules file (as well as the project makerules and the template
##       makefiles) depend on using the GNU version of make.  GNU make 
##		 (which is included in cygwin) must be
##       installed on your system prior to using this makefile.
#=============================================================================#
##
#=============================================================================#
## The following list is the standard list of definitions which will be defined
## or are used in other variable definitions or rules in this makerules file.
## Each global variable name is listed with a definition of the purpose and
## intended use.  Defaults for items are shown in brackets, and may be
## overridden by the user in a local makefile or project makerules file.  If
## no default is shown, the user can use the variable, but should not change
## the value.
##
## Make Control Variables:
##AUTODEP	= environment defined to enable/disable makedepend during
##			  make all phase of build (default is yes, set to no to
##			  disable makedepend)
##BUILD_CONFIG= Type of build to do: debug or release or loadable [debug]
##				Debug release includes CDEBUG/CCDEBUG flags and does not use
##				COPT/CCOPT.  Non-debug omits CDEBUG/CCDEBUG and uses COPT/CCOPT
##				loadable is only allowed for MIPS/VxWorks builds.  This does:
##					Libraries build to .rel files which have all objects in
##					Only SYSLIBS in included in link
##					Firmware/BSP is built with .rel files, BSP has all symbols
##					Hence Unit Tests can be built to a .out and downloaded
##					against a full firmware which was built as loadable as well
##					loadable builds define -DBUILD_LOADABLE so initialization
##					code for system libraries can be disabled in unit tests
